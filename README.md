This project contains the code for a classic Snake game designed to run on Arduino, utilizing an 8x8 LED panel and a joystick. The game offers simple yet engaging gameplay, where the player navigates the snake on the LED matrix, aiming to eat as many points as possible without colliding with the walls or its own tail.
